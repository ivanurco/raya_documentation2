Install
-------

The packages are hosted using PyPi

* `Ra-Ya SDK package <https://pypi.org/project/rayasdk/>`_
* `Ra-Ya Python library package <https://pypi.org/project/raya/>`_

In order to install it execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -m pip install rayasdk raya

``raya`` is a requirement of ``rayasdk``, but it always tries to download the last “release” version, to install a \
“pre-release” version, you must explicitly define the version, to check if the installation was correct open a new terminal and run:

.. code-block:: python

    rayasdk

This should output:

.. code-block:: bash

    usage: rayasdk [-h] [-v | -q]
               {init,scan,connect,run,simulator,kill,update} ...
    rayasdk: error: the following arguments are required: command

Well done! the environment is ready and we can start creating your first robotics app!
