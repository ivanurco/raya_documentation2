Welcome aboard to your Ra-Ya journey
=======================================

Develop anything on robots. It's that simple!
-----------------------------------------------

Ra-Ya platform was founded on the realization that developing robotic 
applications is extremely complex & demands a wide knowledge of low-level 
hardware/code. This complexity reduced significantly the number of developers 
that can/want to develop such applications. That's why we built our product 
having you, the developers, in mind. Our approach is to use syntax and 
languages that are easy to read & write in order to simplify the process and 
enable any developer to be able to develop robotic applications.

This guide will cover all the tools & info that you need as a developer to 
successfully create, test & deploy robotics applications.

Prerequisites
-------------
To work with Ra-Ya, you will need to have an understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and/or Python fundamentals, depending on the type of application you want to develop. If youâ€™re new to JavaScript or need a refresher, you can dive in or brush up at Mozilla Developer Network.

Start Building

The best way to getting started with our platform is by following our step-by-step app creation section. You will get familiar with our fundamentals, dev tools and will equip you with all the knowledge that you need to create your own app from scratch.
